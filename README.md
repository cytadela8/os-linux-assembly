Assembly projects for University of Warsaw course

Here you can find tests for a 18/19 Operating Systems course at University of Warsaw. You are free to contribute - just make a pull request.

### Naming of solutions
Tests with a generator are in a "test" catalogue. For a "script.sh" testing script to work, you need to:
1. Copy your "attack.asm" file to zad1 catalogue
2. Run script.sh.

Tests expecting exit code 0 should have a .0 suffix and those expecting exit code 1 should end with .1

### Future changes
I will make my solution to task 1 public soon after the **20 March** deadline.
